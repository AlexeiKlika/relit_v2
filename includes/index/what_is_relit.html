            <p>This Cycle of Evangelization visualizes the stages of faith a person experiences:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We witness others’ living out their faith</li>
                <li>We hear the Kerygma and the Gospels proclaimed</li>
                <li>We make a decision of faith, leading to conversion in our lives</li>
                <li>We grow deeper in our faith through faith formation programs, such as bible studies</li>
                <li>We are called to share the Gospel and become a witness for others</li>
            </ul>
            <p>But what prepares and equips us to share the Gospel?<br>
            <em>relit</em> fills this missing piece, giving us the tools and preparation to live out our baptismal vocation to mission and evangelization.
            </p>
            <p>"relit is a great training tool to educate, inspire and motivate. I appreciate the real-life stories used throughout the sessions and the multiple examples of testimonies provided to show how we can use words to share what God has done in our lives. My personal favorite session was on the Transcendentals and how we each are attracted to God via Truth, Beauty or Goodness. It will impact how I evangelize one-on-one from now on knowing that I fall into the ‘Goodness’ category!"<br>Katie Dubas  Evangelization &amp; Catechesis  Diocese of Fargo, ND</p>
