            <p>You offer programs on the Bible and sacraments, the virtues and saints… But what program do you offer that <span class="relit-link">teaches how to share the Faith</span>? How to evangelize?</p>

            <p>Be trained how and inspired by <em>relit: The Heart of Evangelization</em>! This one-of-a-kind, DVD training program will revitalize your parish by training your core group how to share the Good News with the rest of your parish and beyond.</p>

            <p>With the <span class="relit-link">practical tools and fresh perspective</span> found in <em>relit</em>, you can make your Bible Studies, Religious Education program, Sacramental Preparation classes, and all your parish activities reach and inspire more parishioners by integrating evangelization.</p>

            <p><em>relit</em> will teach your core group (which may include parish staff, ministry leaders, priests, etc.) how to begin revitalizing your parish in just one weekend! With a familiar DVD-based format, the <em>relit</em> leader’s kit includes participant &amp; facilitator guides filled with practical information and thought-provoking questions that enable your parish to offer relit without any additional leadership training.</p>

            <p>How do you invite people to initial or deeper faith through your programs? How are you using the <span class="relit-link">Thresholds and Transcendentals</span> to share the Faith in a way unique individuals can receive it? How do you identify new opportunities for evangelization within your parish and everyday life?</p>
