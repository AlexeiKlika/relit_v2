            <p>According to research, <span class="relit-link">only 5-10% of parishioners</span> are engaged with their faith. That means, more than 90% of people at the parish are not!</p>

            <p>Right now we're really blessed because there's a tremendous number of new programs and resources that people can use in order to evangelize. But how are we inviting this more than 90% to experience these programs? How can we bring more people to an encounter with Christ?</p>

            <p>The percentage is unique to your parish. But what if we trained the 5-10% of faithful, evangelized Catholics how to evangelize the 95%? What impact would we see?</p>
