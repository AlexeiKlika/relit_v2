				<p>We've all heard the numbers - Mass attendance is descreasing while the number of non-believers increases. While there are over 70 million Catholics in the United States alone, <strong class="relit-link">only 25 percent regularly attend Mass</strong> and only an estimated 5-10% have truly experienced conversion and embraced the Gospel message.</p>

				<p>This presents an incredible challenge, but such an amazing opportunity. Consider your parish. You can fill the pews. You can help engaged couples grow in love of Christ and each other. You can support young families coming to have their children baptized. You can meet your parishioners where they are at in their faith journey. You can evangelize to capture hearts before catechizing to strengthen minds.</p>

				<p>But how? By being trained and formed to re-evangelize the baptized.</p>
