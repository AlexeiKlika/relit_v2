            <p>"Everything takes time, but we had this initial fire that came right out of relit. Personally, in my own priesthood, in my own ministry, I speak to couples preparing for marriage in a different way.</p>
            <p>I sort of face-palmed when I was first going through relit. I'm literally filling out paperwork or talking about ‘Have we decided if we're going to put a star or an angel on top of the Christmas tree? Have we had these serious conversations?'</p>
            <p>Rather than 'Do you know Jesus Christ? Are you head over heels in love with Him? Would you give your life for Him?'</p>
            <p>So, that's a change I’ve made. I know our baptismal preparation is different. It's less catechetical, more evangelical. The Knights of Columbus are on board, our religious education program.</p>
            <p>It's just given us a new lens through which we view everything that we do.”</p>
