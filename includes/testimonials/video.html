            <p>This is an excellent resource for training for the New Evangelization.

            <p><em>relit</em> is a great training tool to educate, inspire and motivate. I appreciate the real-life stories used throughout the sessions and the multiple examples of testimonies provided to show how we can use words to share what God has done in our lives. My personal favorite session was on the Transendentals and how we each are attracted to God via Truth, Beauty or Goodness. It will impact how I evangelize one-on-one from now on knowing that I fall into the 'Goodness' category!</p>
