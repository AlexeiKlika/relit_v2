				<p>Michael Dopp was a luke-warm Catholic until he encountered the goodness and love of God at World Youth Day in Rome. The fruit of this encounter and his surrender to the mercy of God was the intentional living out of the richness of the faith. Michael soon felt the call to share Christâ€™s message with others and evangelize.</p>
				<p><em>relit: The Heart of Evangelization</em> is the fruit of Michael's desire to add strategy to the universal call to evangelize. He saw the need for a training program that was accessible to active Catholic, from parishioners to priests, which would form them to be effective evangelists. The key to the new evangelization is forged in the fire of relit.</p>
				<p>When he's not busy travelling across North America to share his unique message of training Catholics in how to evangelize, Michael lives in Ottawa, Canada and enjoys reading with a pumpkin spice latte or delighting in the goodness of his wife Linda and daughter Therese.</p>
